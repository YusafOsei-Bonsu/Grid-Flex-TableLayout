                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Grid is a 2D-based layout with the <strong>aim of organising elements in a table-like fashion</strong>. CSS has always been used to lay out our web pages, but it’s never done a very good job of it. First, tables, floats, positioning and inline-block were used, but they essentially left out a lot of important functionality; in response to this, Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the common layout problems encountered by web developers over the years.</p>
