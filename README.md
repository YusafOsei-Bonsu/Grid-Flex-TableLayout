## Project Overview

First, I created the homepage (`home.html`), which briefly states the content of the website. After this, I created the remaining three pages: Grid (`grid.html`), Flexbox (`flex.html`) and Table Layout (`table.html`). Each page contains a Bootstrap-styled navigation bar, which was placed in all HTML pages.

Next, I created and styled an introduction, browser-support, terminology and CSS properties section for the Grid (`grid.html`) and Flexbox (`flex.html`) pages. Unlike these pages, the Table Layout page did not have a properties section, since Table Layout (`table.html`) is a CSS property; therefore, I presented the values of Table Layout instead. In case of JavaScript in the Grid page, there are a pair of buttons that display a table of Grid item/container properties.
